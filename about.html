        <br>By using what begins in the fertile ground of a small Woolooga property, 45km West of Gympie Cecilia "CC" Diaz-Petersen is adding to the foodie world with her mouth-watering range of fine foods.</br>

        <br>Born in the Philippines, CC's passion for food and cooking started at a young age with influences from her mother, grandmothers, uncles and aunties - all excellent home-grown cooks.</br>

        <br>In 1987, CC moved to Australia with her parents and 2 siblings. After almost a decade working as a Real Estate Sales Agent in Sydney and Wide Bay Region, CC decided to chase her dream and launched CC's Kitchen in early 2011.</br>

        <br>A taste of CC's products takes you back in time - a time before preservatives and artificial flavourings and colourings - when food went straight from the garden to the pot to the plate.</br>

        <br>A good dose of love, time and patience are the keys ingredients. All products are 100% made and produced right here at the Petersen's Farm at Woolooga, Queensland 40 kms West of Gympie grown by Greg Petersen, CC's husband and his parents. We utilise fresh produce such as gourmet tomatoes, green papaya, herbs, rosellas, gooseberries, chillies, beans, cauliflower, zucchinis, eggplant and wide variety of Asian veggies. All cooked and seasoned with homemade love!</br>

        <br>They are the stars of CC's ever growing product range - a seasonal affair where CC makes everything by hand in her kitchen and where chunks of real food and flavour leave supermarket pureed versions in the dust. It's like what grandma used to make - it's a premium product using the best of Gympie produce.</br>

        <br>CC's Kitchen products can be found in speciality shops and butcher shops, trade shows/festivals or at markets around the region from Maryborough, Hervey Bay, Tin Can Bay, Sunshine Coast and Brisbane area.</br>
